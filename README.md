# PW android test
This is a test, not all things work. Download [here](https://github.com/plugin-warp/android-webkit/releases/tags/alpha)

## TODO
#### Turn this:
The downloader is scuffed, it scrapes the console looking for messages by extensionDownloader.js, and sets the name based on the link, and the content based on the js data below it.
#### Into this:
Use source urls instead of blobs, that way the app can interface correctly.
